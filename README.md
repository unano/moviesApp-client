# Agile Software Practice.


## App Features.

+ watchlistPage & topRatedPage & collection page

Tests: cypress/integration/navigation.spec ;  cypress/integration/button.spec.js

Since these pages have nearly UI styles and code as homePage, I don't attach all screenshots of these pages, the screenshot of topRatedMoviesPage can be a reference. 
And since the codes are nearly the sane as homepage. I just test whether their navigations and buttons are well and won't have peoblems, such as navigating to a wrong page.

![][topRatedMovies]


+ Movie Details page(similar movies) - There will be a list of similar movies at the bottom of this page.

Tests: cypress/integration/movieDetails.spec.js 

![][movieDetail]

![][similarMovies]


+ popularPeoplePage - show popluar movie actors with popularity. Providing filter for user.

Test: cypress/integration/popularPerson-page.spec.js

![][popularPerson]

### Advanced Testing (If required).

+ The code cover of certain test

![][partCoverage]


+ The code cover of all test

![][allCoverage01]

![][allCoverage02]

+ Try to use gitlabRunner(Although the result seemed not so good...)
